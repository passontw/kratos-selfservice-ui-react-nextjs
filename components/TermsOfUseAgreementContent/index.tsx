          <StyledDiv>
          You represent and warrant that you have the right to use any credit card or other means of payment that you provide to us. By providing payment card information to us, you authorize us to store and use the card as a payment method for purchases made through your Cooler Master account, including on affiliated sites and properties which you access via your Cooler Master account credentials.
          </StyledDiv>
          <StyledDiv>
          Cooler Master participates in account update services offered by some banks. If your bank participates in account updater services, these services will automatically update your card number or expiration date in our system when it changes. If you do not want to have your cards automatically updated, you can opt out of these services by contacting your issuing bank.
          </StyledDiv>
          <StyledDiv>
          All billing information you provide to us must be truthful and accurate. Providing any untruthful or inaccurate information is a breach of these Terms of Use and may result in cancellation of your order. Prior to accepting an order, we may also request additional information from you. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any purchase.
          </StyledDiv>
          <StyledDiv>
          We reserve the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason including limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies, or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge. We will attempt to contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. Cooler Master may request a pre-authorization for some orders placed online with a credit or debit card. This pre-authorization will not be billed to you; however, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short period. Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is held. We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that you have sufficient funds to complete the transaction.
          </StyledDiv>
          <StyledDiv>
          By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the Products, as well as all shipping and handling charges and applicable taxes. You will not be charged for most orders until the order has shipped.

          </StyledDiv>
          <StyledDiv>
          Cooler Master reserves the right, including without prior notice, to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household, or per order for any reason. We will attempt to notify you should such limits be applied. Cooler Master also reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to prohibit sales to dealers or resellers. For purposes of these Terms of Use, “reselling” will be defined as purchasing or intending to purchase any Product(s) from Cooler Master for the purpose of engaging in a commercial sale of the same Product(s) to a third party.
          </StyledDiv>
          <StyledDiv>
          In addition to any other remedies available to it, Cooler Master may in its sole discretion restrict or terminate your account, or cancel or refuse orders for violations of, or abuse of, Cooler Master’s returns policy.
          </StyledDiv>
          <StyledTitle>B. Pricing Information; Availability</StyledTitle>
          <StyledDiv>
          Cooler Master cannot confirm the price or availability of an item until after an order is placed. Pricing or availability errors may occur on the Site or through third party retailers. The receipt of an order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a Product. Cooler Master reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing or availability errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice from Cooler Master. Cooler Master may, at its discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Pricing for products on the Site may be different from prices available from third party retailers.
          </StyledDiv>
          <StyledDiv>
          Prices provided on the Site are subject to change without advance notice. Cooler Master strives to communicate accurate pricing and product information, but errors may occur. In the unlikely event that an error impacts your order, or Product that has been ordered is no longer available, we will either contact you for further instructions or cancel your order at our sole discretion.
          </StyledDiv>
          <StyledTitle>C. Promotional Codes</StyledTitle>
          <StyledDiv>
          Promotional codes are limited in nature and may expire or be discontinued with or without notice. Promotional codes are void where prohibited by law. Promotional codes may not be copied, sold, or otherwise transferred. They are not redeemable for cash and are subject to cancellation or change at any time for any reason without notice. We reserve the right in our discretion to impose conditions on the offering of any promotional code.

        <StyledTitle>IX. Shipping and Delivery</StyledTitle>

These Terms of Use do not, and shall not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency, or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and Cooler Master or any of Cooler Master’s Affiliates. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and the other terms of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect. The failure of Cooler Master to act with respect to a breach of these Terms of Use by you or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit Cooler Master’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.
