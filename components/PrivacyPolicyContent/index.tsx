      </StyledSection>

      <StyledTitle >WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</StyledTitle>
      <StyledSection >
      When you visit the Cooler Master Sites, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. (See the “Behavioral Advertising” section below for more information on certain third parties who may also collect similar information when you visit the Cooler Master Sites for online behavioral advertising purposes.) This includes which pages are visited, which advertisements are viewed, and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible. For purposes of clarity, unless visitors submit personal information directly to us (e.g. by means of a site registration, in connection with a contest, etc.), our sites do not collect visitor’s personal information. Additional information on how we treat personal information that is submitted directly to us and how such information may be shared may be found in the detailed statement of our privacy policy below.

      <StyledTitle >BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING</StyledTitle>
      <StyledDiv >
      We analyze non-personal information that we collect on the Cooler Master Sites, or obtain from third parties, and organize it into anonymous user profiles, groups, and audiences, based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests, and online actions. We, our clients, and/or partners then use these anonymous user profiles, groups, and audiences to design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content. We and our clients also use this data for other related purposes (e.g. to do research regarding the results of our online advertising campaigns or to better understand the interests or activities of our visitors.) The behavioral categories we use to customize the ads you may see or for related purposes do not use personal information such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, birth date, or social security number. Our technology and services are designed to limit our use of data for purposes of behavioral advertising to anonymous, non-personal information.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledDiv >
      When you visit any of the Cooler Master Sites and view ads from Cooler Master’s advertisers, Cooler Master automatically receives and stores certain types of non-personal information including IP address, web pages viewed, date and time, and responses to advertisements delivered. While each advertising technology uses different types of technology to collect this information, including log files, cookies, and pixels, none of the foregoing by itself or together can be tracked to a specific individual’s personal information, and the non-personal information collected by Cooler Master Technology Incwill not be shared with third parties, except as expressly indicated in this policy. The non-personal information collected through your use of the Cooler Master Sites is used: to provide relevant, targeted advertising and improve Cooler Master’s advertising technology; to monitor website traffic; to collect statistical data; to determine the effectiveness of advertisements and content; and to collect data across multiple websites to categorize likely consumer interest segments for use in online behavioral advertising. Cooler Master may track visits to the Cooler Master Sites and this information may be used over time to help predict your consumer interest segments and select the ad content you see. Cooler Master may also use non-personally identifiable profile-based anonymous information with other non-personal information.
      </StyledDiv>

      <StyledTitle >TRANSPARENCY IN ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING</StyledTitle>
      <StyledSection >
      Cooler Master does not create or use potentially sensitive data segments to provide its targeted online behavioral advertising for advertisers, including, but not limited to, health related audience segments.

      <StyledSection >
      You may choose to not participate in our personalized advertising services by “opting out” of such personalized advertising services through the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-out Program. Opting out will not remove advertisements. You will continue to see advertisements provided by Cooler Master, but the advertising will not be customized or targeted based on information collected by Cooler Master.

      </StyledSection>

      <StyledTitle >DATA RETENTION</StyledTitle>
      <StyledSection >
      We and our partners may retain the anonymous user data we or our partners collect on the Cooler Master Sites for up to nine (9) months from the date of its collection, after which time it is deleted from, or deactivated on, our and our partners’ active databases. In addition, we maintain archives of our web logs, database, and other systems and information. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived after we delete or deactivate the information from its active database. We maintain archives for disaster recovery, legal and other non-marketing purposes.
      </StyledSection>

      <StyledTitle >WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE?</StyledTitle>
      <StyledSection >
      Except as may otherwise be expressly set forth in this policy or in our privacy policy, Cooler Master does not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifying information with third parties unless the individual user(s) consent to such sharing practices. We may from time to time share user information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to users more targeted advertising, products and services.
      </StyledSection>

      <StyledTitle>WHAT ARE "COOKIES" AND "WEB BEACONS" AND HOW DO WE USE THEM?</StyledTitle>
      <StyledSection >
      The Cooler Master Sites may use “cookies” and “web beacons” to speed navigation, keep track of items viewed, clicked on, and/or shared, including links and advertisements, and provide you with custom-tailored services. A “web beacon” is an embedded GIF file that specifically helps us track whether you have viewed a specific piece of content. We also use “cookies” to remember information you gave us so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit the Cooler Master Sites. By showing us how and when visitors use the Cooler Master Sites, “cookies” and “web beacons” allow us to see which Cooler Master Site areas and content are popular, and help us target content and advertisements based on user behavior. In addition, “cookies” will allow us to display in your profile which Cooler Master and affiliated websites you have visited, unless you opt out of that feature in your account. We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to any sponsors. Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own “cookies.” We do not control these “cookies.” You should check the privacy policy of these advertisers or websites to see whether and how they use “cookies.” Most browsers are initially set to accept “cookies.” If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse “cookies.” You will not be able to fully use the Cooler Master Sites if you turn off the “cookies" option.

      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledTitle>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.</StyledTitle>
      <StyledDiv>
      We use your personal information to provide you with products and/or services that you have requested, to respond to questions or communications and to get in touch with you when necessary. For example, we may use your personal information to communicate with you or to send you information that you have requested. We may send you an e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested in or asking you to participate in a survey. We do not consider any companies that are within our “family” of companies to be “third parties” for purposes of this policy. Thus, we may also share personal information with Cooler Master Affiliates. Cooler Master Affiliates may use and further share personal information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on personal information to a Cooler Master Affiliate, we require that it protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy and your expressed preferences. For example, a Cooler Master Affiliate may send you an e-mail regarding special offers and announcements about products or services that it thinks might be of interest to you, or contact you offline. If you want to opt-out from our (or an Affiliate) using the personal information you provided in these ways, please contact us. Please see “How to Contact Us” later in this policy.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledTitle>HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.</StyledTitle>
      <StyledDiv>
      We will not share your personal information with third parties except (a) if it is for the purpose(s) for which you provided it; (b) as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g. in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another); and/or (c) with other persons, service providers, or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal operations or our business activities (e.g. sending out a product or a promotional item that you have requested on the Cooler Master Sites). Examples of us sharing your personal information for the purposes submitted are if you participate in a third-party survey or request information from a third-party, we may provide the information provided to such third party so that they can send to you directly the information you requested. Additionally, with your consent, we may share your personal information with companies not affiliated with us who are interested in marketing their products or services to you or in asking you questions, both online and offline.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledDiv>
      Companies with whom we might share your personal information may include consumer products, telecom, financial, military, market research, entertainment, and educational services companies and their third party service providers. If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online. In this instance, any changes or amendments to your personal information must be given directly to each company who communicates with you as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will not be exchanged between us and non-affiliated companies. If we do share personal information with a non-affiliated company, to the extent practical, we require that they protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. We cannot, however, guarantee how these non-affiliated companies will use your personal information.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledTitle>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF ANONYMOUS INFORMATION.</StyledTitle>
      <StyledDiv>
      We may use the non-personal information that we collect to improve the design and content of the Cooler Master Sites and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience, including the ads that you see. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how the Cooler Master Sites are used, as well as to offer you products, programs or services. See the “Online Tracking and Advertising” section below for more information on personalized ads (also known as online behavioral advertising). We also share aggregate information with Cooler Master Affiliates and third parties.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledTitle>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY OTHERS.</StyledTitle>
      <StyledDiv>
      The Cooler Master Sites may contain links to other websites, including links that are placed there by us, such as third-party advertisements or text hyperlinks. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other website. We encourage all users of the Cooler Master Sites to be aware of when they leave the Cooler Master Sites, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personal information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by the Cooler Master Sites through the Cooler Master Sites. We may offer additional e-mail services or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated companies. Based on our agreement with them, these third parties may obtain personal information that visitors to the Cooler Master Sites voluntarily submit to participate in these additional e-mail services or promotions. We have no control over the use of this information by these non-affiliated companies.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledTitle>ONLINE TRACKING AND ADVERTISING.</StyledTitle>
      <StyledDiv>
      We collect information regarding visitors to the Cooler Master Sites through various technologies, such as cookies, Flash cookies and Web beacons, including when you visit the Cooler Master Site or use our applications on third-party sites or platforms. Please see “Internet Ads” for further information regarding this collection and usage.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledTitle>CLICKSTREAM DATA.</StyledTitle>
      <StyledDiv>
      As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This anonymous information, which is sometimes referred to as “Clickstream Data,” can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream Data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Cooler Master Site. We may use Clickstream Data as a form of non-personal information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Cooler Master Sites, how visitors navigate throughout the Cooler Master Sites, and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. Any collection or use of Clickstream Data will be anonymous and aggregated.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledTitle>INTERNET ADS</StyledTitle>
      <StyledDiv>
      Interest-based ads are sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads. We show interest-based ads to display features, products, and/or services that might be of interest to you. To serve you interest-based ads, we use information such as your interactions with the Cooler Master Sites, content, or services. We do not use information which on its own identifies you, such as name or e-mail address, to serve interest-based ads. As is common in the advertising industry, we use cookies, pixels, and other technologies, which enable us to understand the effectiveness of the interest-based ads we show you by measuring what ads are clicked or viewed, and to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. For example, if we know what ads are shown to your browser we can be careful not to show the same ads repeatedly.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledDiv>
      We work with third parties, such as advertisers, publishers, social media networks, search engines, ad serving companies, and advertising companies working on their behalf, to improve the relevance of ads we serve. In providing you with interest-based ads, we do not associate your interactions on unaffiliated sites with information which on its own identifies you, such as name or email address, and we do not provide any such information to advertisers or to third-party sites that display our interest-based ads. Advertisers and other third parties may assume that users who interact with or click on an interest-based ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (e.g. users in a particular geographical area or users who purchased or browsed for computer cooling system/devices). Some third-parties may provide us pseudonymized information about you (such as demographic information or sites where you have been shown ads) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledDiv>
      Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads, directly to your browser or device, and they may automatically receive an IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, show you more relevant advertising content, and perform services on behalf of Cooler Master.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledDiv>
      Cooler Master offers you choices about receiving interest-based ads from us. You can choose not to receive interest-based ads from us. You will still see ads but they will not be based on your interests.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledDiv>
      You can also generally opt out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt out pages on the NAI website and DAA website.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledTitle>SUPPLEMENTING INFORMATION.</StyledTitle>
      <StyledDiv>
      From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address. Thus, information we obtain through the Cooler Master Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Cooler Master Sites, including both offline and online sources.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledTitle>DISCUSSIONS AND COMMUNITY TOOLS.</StyledTitle>
      <StyledDiv>
      We may, from time to time, make review lists, chat rooms, forums, message boards, blogs, newsgroups and other community tools available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use. For example, from time to time, we may use the content you write (including your name or screen name if you post it) for promotional purposes, in e-mail newsletters or elsewhere, and by using the Cooler Master Site sand/or these chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and other community tools, you agree that we may do so. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone - not just us - may access your publicly posted information.
      </StyledDiv>
      <StyledTitle>OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY.</StyledTitle>
      <StyledDiv>
      We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the personal information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet including, without limitation, emails. Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that we have no liability regarding the theft, loss, alteration or misuse of personal information, including such information that has been provided to third parties or other users, or with regard to the failure of a third party to abide by the agreement between us and such third party.
      </StyledDiv>
